# SQLLibraryProject
A collaboration I did with a partner that involves a using a database system. The overall objective was to make a library where you can check out or check in a book. A librarian can also add books to the collect and the library itself can hire more librarians.

The LibraryDatabase txt has the text required to set up a database via microsoft SQL. The datamanipulation txt has suggest queries. The folder has screenshots of doing these queries in action.

Before the implementation of this database, there was some design phases that happen. There was a dictionary, an ER diagram, and a relational model. This shows the result of a month long project.
